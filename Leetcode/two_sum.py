# CHALLENGE 1: TWO SUM

## Given an array of intergers "nums" and an interger "target", return the INDICES
## of the two numbers that add up to the target. 
## You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not
## use the same element twice. 
## You can return it in any order.

# Test Case:
## >>> nums = [3,2,6,8]
## >>> target = 9
## [0,2]   (Because nums[0] + nums[2] == 9)

# Pseudocode:
## define a function that takes in a list of numbers, and a target
## create an empty dictionary to store the values of what we have checked
